h-BN features a relatively smooth surface meaning is primarily free of dangling bonds and charge traps. Dangins bonds can be described as double or triple bonds and charge traps are a site that can temporarily hold electrons. Many compare h-BN to SiO2 in order to show its capabilities. For example, we often use a mechanical transfer process to create graphene devices on SiO2 surfaces, however we sometimes wonder if this surface can be improved, which is where h-BN comes into play. h-BN is an electrical insulator that has the ability to become polarized when in an electric field. It is also relatively intert, and the combination of these two qualities helps it perform well. SiO2 is limited by its rough surface such as electron and hole puddles, and impurities that cause doping which is when there are too many holes or electrons. h-BN has a planar surface which allows for smooth electron movement.It is 3 times smoother than SiO2. Graphene conforms to any surface which makes it highly susceptible to any imperfections of the surface. In h-BN, it is important to keep in mind that optical phonons do not play a significant role. This is because short range scattering dominates in h-BN. This means that the primary scattering occurs due to the lattice pattern. In some materials short range scattering dominates since there are significantly more imperfections on the surface. The smoothness of h-BN allows scattering to occur not due to these imperfections.

h-BN has a variety of different uses throughout immensely different applications. 2D layers of h-BN have been found to have superior mobility and carrier inhomogenerity when compared to SiO2. This suggests that it could be used for UV detects, photo emission, and ultraviolet lasing. As stated above h-BN is very inert, meaning not very chemically reactive. This allows it to be a good option to use as a barrier from corrosion and oxidation in a variety of applicationg (i.e. batteries where it could increase oxidation resistance), and for radiation shielding. It has also been used to isolate electrodes again, in batteries. It may potentially also have medical benefits such as improving bonr regeneration. h-BN had also been used to optimize thermal conductivity of polymers and electrical insulation in batteries. In daily life it has even been found in the majority of make-up and skincare products. (https://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6231)
